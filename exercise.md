 # Exercise #3
 
 ## Planning a Shopping Website Project in React and Node.js
 
 You are planning to create a shopping website using React (frontend) and Node.js (backend). The site should allow users to:
 
 - Browse products by category
 - Search for items
 - Add products to a cart
 - Complete checkout
 
 **Instructions:**
 
 1. **Create an Epic:**  
	 Create a new epic in Copilot Web for the shopping website project.

 2. **Break Down the Epic:**  
	 Under the epic, create feature issues for each major functionality:
	 - Product Browsing by Category
	 - Product Search
	 - Shopping Cart
	 - Checkout Process
 
 3. **Create Tasks:**  
	 For each feature, break it down into smaller tasks. Example tasks:
	 - Design UI components in React
	 - Set up Node.js API endpoints
	 - Implement product listing and filtering
	 - Integrate cart functionality
	 - Build checkout and payment flow
 
 4. **Use Copilot Web:**  
	 Use Copilot Web to create the epic, features, and tasks.  
	 Specify the repository as needed (e.g., `your-org/shopping-website`).
 
 **Example prompt:**
 
 `your-org/shopping-website, create an epic for building a shopping website in React and Node.js. Add feature issues for product browsing, search, cart, and checkout. Break each feature into tasks such as UI design, API development, and integration.`
 

 **Further Refinement prompts:**

- Based on the project plan, can you break down the issue "Feature: Cart Management" into smaller tasks?

- Can you improve the description for “Task: Create placeholder pages for main routes”? Please provide a detailed technical summary, list the main routes to be included, outline the steps for implementation, and specify what should be delivered for this task.
